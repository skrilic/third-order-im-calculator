# third-order-im-calculator
  Web browser extension "third-order-im-calculator" (TOIC) is the calculator of the third order intermodulation products for collocated transmitters.
It calculates all possible frequencies combinations by formulas f<sub>im</sub> = 2*f<sub>x</sub>-f<sub>y</sub> and f<sub>im</sub> = f<sub>x</sub>+f<sub>y</sub>-f<sub>z</sub>, over the set of frequencies F = { f<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, ..., f<sub>n-1</sub>}. f<sub>x</sub>, f<sub>y</sub>, f<sub>z</sub> &isin; F where x,y,z &isin; [0, 1, ..., n-1] and x &ne; y &ne; z, excluding negative results.

### Main features
- Clearly describes every calculated product in column "description".
- IM products could be sorted and searched by frequency and by description.
- List of calculated IM products could be downloaded as CSV file.
