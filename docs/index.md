## Third order intermodulation calculator

  Web browser extension "third-order-im-calculator" (TOIC) is the calculator of the third order intermodulation products for collocated transmitters. It calculates all possible frequencies combinations by formulas 
  f<sub>im</sub> = 2*f<sub>x</sub> - f<sub>y</sub> and f<sub>im</sub> = f<sub>x</sub> + f<sub>y</sub> - f<sub>z</sub> , over the set of frequencies F = { f ~0~ , f ~1~ , f ~2~ , ..., f ~n-1~ }. f ~x~ , f ~y~ , f~z~ ∈ F where x,y,z ∈ [0, 1, ..., n-1] and x ≠ y ≠ z, excluding negative results.


### Main features

* Clearly describes every calculated product in column "description".
* IM products could be sorted and searched by frequency and by description.
* List of calculated IM products could be downloaded as CSV file.
