## Third order intermodulation calculator

  Web browser extension "third-order-im-calculator" (TOIC) is the calculator of the third order intermodulation products for collocated transmitters. It calculates all possible frequencies combinations by formulas

  f<sub>im</sub> = 2f<sub>x</sub> - f<sub>y</sub> and f<sub>im</sub> = f<sub>x</sub> + f<sub>y</sub> - f <sub>z</sub> , over the set of frequencies F = { f<sub>0</sub> , f<sub>1</sub> , f<sub>2</sub> , ..., f<sub>n-1</sub> }. f<sub>x</sub> , f<sub>y</sub> , f<sub>z</sub> ∈ F where x,y,z ∈ [0, 1, ..., n-1] and x ≠ y ≠ z, excluding negative results.

### Main features

* Clearly describes every calculated product in column "description".
* IM products could be sorted and searched by frequency and by description.
* List of calculated IM products could be downloaded as CSV file.
